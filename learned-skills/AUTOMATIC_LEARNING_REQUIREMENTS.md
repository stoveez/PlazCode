# Automatic shared solution learning — next update requirement

Shared solution learning is a core PlazCode feature, not an opt-in add-on. This requirement supersedes the optional community-learning design in 1.23.0. It is a product requirement, not a claim that the published binary already implements it.

## Required behavior

- Fetch and apply verified global lessons automatically, including for installations whose older settings have shared learning disabled.
- Before solving a task, retrieve relevant successful methods and corrections, inspect the current project, and adapt the method to its structure and constraints.
- After a task succeeds and its relevant checks pass, automatically derive a reusable candidate from observable actions and outcomes. A task marked complete without successful checks is insufficient.
- Automatically contribute only candidates that pass local privacy checks and server validation. Require no shared-learning toggle, per-contribution user interaction or repository-write token for ordinary users.
- Exclude raw conversations, hidden reasoning, project source/assets, credentials, personal information, user/project identifiers, private paths, URLs containing private identifiers, and user content embedded in errors or tool arguments.
- Use a bounded structured schema and fail-closed filtering before transmission. Arbitrary tool-step strings, raw logs, free-form model summaries or hashes of private text are not safe automatic-upload payloads.
- Keep any candidate that cannot be safely abstracted local. Mandatory shared learning does not authorize uploading private material.
- Deduplicate, version and validate candidates; reject poisoned instructions, unverified fixes and attempts to override project/user requirements. Automatically validated lessons can enter the global index; candidates outside automatic verification coverage require maintainer review before global reuse.
- Sync accepted lessons promptly with bounded requests and cached offline operation. Shared-service failure must not block or damage a project.
- Show clear in-app information about the limited data contributed and the shared methods used.
- Preserve existing working provider, tool, Studio, modeller, UI maker and Blender behavior.

## Infrastructure required

The current GitHub proposal path requires PLAZCODE_GITHUB_TOKEN with write access to the repository. It does not implement a general user collection service. Do not embed a maintainer token in the app or give every installation repository write access.

Implement a collection service with constrained public submission schemas, rate limits, abuse controls, replay/deduplication handling, server-side validation, and deletion/retraction of unsafe or incorrect lessons. The service holds publishing credentials; clients do not. A GitHub-backed approved index can remain the distribution mechanism. A real deployment and a published endpoint are required before claiming automatic cross-user contribution works.

## What improves and how to measure it

This improves PlazCode's orchestration, retrieval and project-adapted solution reuse. It does not update the weights of ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek or other provider models. Actual model-weight training would require a separate model training program and deployment.

Measure first-attempt correctness, successful completion rate, tool errors/retries, regression rate, latency and cost on held-out tasks. Compare identical provider/model versions with and without the shared index. Keep benchmark answers and evaluation tasks out of the learned index used for that evaluation. Report evidence, not a promised benchmark-score increase or guaranteed instant solution.

## Delivery gates

- New and upgraded installations retrieve global methods without opt-in.
- Newly verified public-safe methods can contribute without users providing GitHub write credentials.
- Tests prove private strings and unapproved payload fields never leave the device.
- Tests cover invalid lessons, poisoning, retries, duplicate submissions, service outages, retractions and project adaptation.
- End-to-end testing verifies one installation's safe validated lesson becomes usable on another installation.
- Existing regressions pass and future release descriptions retain the existing format with fewer than 2,000 characters.
