# PlazCode 1.24.6

Validation: local JavaScript and browser checks in progress; exact-source platform CI pending. Release promotion must require all four validation jobs and the real macOS desktop check.

Changes cover command deadlines, cancellation continuation, updater helper selection/launch policy, Skills importing, checklist retention and targeted provider DOM/input cleanup. Startup protocol, tool parsing, native remote authority, pairing, checksum validation, rollback and user storage remain covered by their existing regression suites.

Native Studio MCP uses one absolute deadline, including stdin writes, and tests cover noisy notifications, wrong response IDs, blocked writes and repeated healthy calls. Add-on stdin writes share their existing read deadline. Content-script background requests resolve once with a bounded deadline and ignore late replies; stopped requests retain drain guards. A provider generation flag alone cannot reset progress forever. Fresh native requests remain deferred until the old loop/cancellation drains; a later Stop invalidates them. Already-executed commands keep their existing deduplication records.

Automatic updates stage the embedded helper, preserving the installed copy. Windows helper launch uses process-scoped ExecutionPolicy Bypass; no machine policy changes. Real Windows tests cover Restricted parent process policy for automatic and BAT launches; package installation, checksums, settings preservation, backup/rollback, automatic triggers and relaunch tests remain required.

JSON/text imports reuse the validated save API with a new ID. They preserve Unicode content and existing skills, reject oversized/malformed data and begin unverified. Import is local and does not execute helpers or publish content.

Provider DOM fixtures simulate responses and the bridge. Live signed-in account behavior and real Roblox Studio remain unverified. Windows builds are unsigned and macOS uses ad-hoc signing. Release notes follow current emoji headings and concise bold-label bullets, well below 2,000 words (also within the repository's existing 2,000-character guard).

Main checklist labels and verified status survive native follow-ups, Markdown updates and tab refreshes in per-chat session storage. New work can be appended; explicit task replacement/abandonment starts a fresh plan. Timestamp DOM nodes are excluded without rewriting the host transcript or deleting literal times from user text. Chromium/Firefox layout fixtures verify icon gaps, row padding and header spacing.

DOM hardening retains the existing safe selectors, layout guards and bounded predicates for all supported adapters. Missed tooltips/control types/inline style reads are guarded. Temporary input changes now enter try/finally before unlocking or hiding; Kimi releases its internal injection flag even if restoration fails. Deep semantic Notion composer fallback is used only if bounded normal lookup fails and refuses boundaries with another editor. No new polling or broad observer was introduced. Tests cover 19 input failure/submission scenarios, 305 DOM resilience cases and 65 healthy differential checks; 1,072 untouched provider functions retain their original control flow.

Claude screenshot submissions require a confirmed upload and enabled send control, then click once and use a bounded receipt wait. Delayed acceptance cannot trigger repeat clicks.

Recovery also bounds total native tool work including mutex queues and checkpoint processing, and helper process cleanup uses asynchronous deadlines. Cancellation only resets an interrupted owned helper; a queued request never waits for or resets another task’s busy helper. Status probes use 15-second deadlines and only one outstanding probe. Whitespace and PlazCode timer chips are excluded from meaningful model progress. Immediate Stop permits a fresh native message while its execution remains deferred until drain. Prior queue/cancellation regressions and real Chromium/Firefox production command-watcher fixtures are retained.
